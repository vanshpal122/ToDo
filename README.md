Never forget your Events ToDo, schedule your latest events and get a reminder , presenting the ToDo App</br>

For Fellow Devs:
1) Used RoomDatabase to store the event details and timings 
2) Used AlarmManger to schedule alarms, passing on the Pending Intent with Event Details as Intent Extras
3) Used BroadcastReceiver for giving out notification based on the received Intent from the AlarmManager
4) Followed MVVM pattern and Dependency Injection Technique
5) Used NavGraph for navigating through different screens in the App.
